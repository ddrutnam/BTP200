Workshops (ws)

    Weekly assignments
    in-labs are workshops done in class with the professor
    at-home workshops are a continuation of in-labs but with an added level of difficulty and is, as would be expected, to be done "at home"

Milestones (ms)

    Breakdown of a project
    Assigned within the last couple of weeks of the term and to be completed alongside the weekly assignments
    Each milestone can be given anywhere from a week to a few days to complete

Other things to note

    Depending on the workshop or milestone, header and implementation files may have already been provided by the professor.
        Oftentimes it is the header files and main cpp file that are given. To see if it has been provided, check the PDF instructions or what files are available for the given lab under the OOP-Workshops-master folder.

    All work for this course is done on Visual Studio and submitted via PuTTy.
        Files are transferred on WinSCP then ran on the terminal. All code must match the output exactly as seen in the instructions.
